    <h3 style="color: white;">What is Networking and distributed systems? Networking and distributed systems provide users with the ability to communicate with each other, store data all over a Network between multiple hardware devices such as computers. These hardware devices work as multiple computers acting as one over a network for all users working with a distributed system.</h3>

    <h3 style="color: white;" align="right">Organizations May tend to install and use distributed systems because of  its Benefits. such as Horizontal scalability such as being able to add more nodes (system parts name) and it being inexpensive. Reliability, distributed systems tend to have fault tolerance because of the large number of nodes that work together and if one machine fails the rest dont stop working. Performance, a Distributed system takes a work or goal given and splits the work all throughout its other nodes/machines to make efficient use of its time to complete its task</h3>

    <h3 style="color: white;">With good comes the bad. With Networking and distributed systems there's challenges for organizations that come with this type of hardware devices. Such as <b style="color: rgb(192, 43, 68);">Scheduling, latency, and observability</b> with Scheduling the system decides what jobs to run, when to run, and where to run causing limitations and unpredictable run times. Since a distributed system is ran over a network organizations are bound to meet with latency well communicating with each other, as for observability it's challenging to view the process, presenting and monitoring the machines work.</h3>

    <h3 style="color: white;">Distributed systems can be seen as computers, physical servers, or virtual machines that connect to the network and communicate by sending messages across to one another. distributed systems function in two main ways one that they work towards one same goal, Two each machine on the network has their own end-user and share resources or communicate between one another over the network to help.</h3>

    <h3 style="color: white;">conclusion, What are networking and distributed systems? Multiple machines that act as one, breaking tasks given into parts to spread out over the other machines that make it one to finish the task with the ability to work over the network of an organization's location allowing resources to be stored, sent and end-users to communicate.</h3>
